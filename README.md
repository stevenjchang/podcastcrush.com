This project is built off a simple template that I made https://github.com/stevenjchang/cra-tailwindcss_template, 

and was boostrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`
- to start, and build css once
### `npm run build:style`
- to just build css
### `npm start` + `npm run watch` (in separate terminals)
- to start and watch for changes to `src/styles` folder
